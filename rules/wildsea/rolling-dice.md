# Dice Pools

> Edge (1d6) + Skill / Language (0-3d6) + Advantage (0-2d6)

- You can only use one edge and one skill or language for a roll
- Advantage is situational bonuses (discuss with the firefly)

# Outcome

Pick the highest dice in the pool, thats the result.

| Result  | Outcome                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 6       | Triumph - Complete success with no drawbacks        |
| 4, 5    | Conflict - Success, but at a cost                   |
| 1, 2, 3 | Disaster - Failure, introduces a narrative drawback |

# Twists

- If you roll _doubles_, the roll also introduces a twist
  - If you roll multiple doubles, its still just a single twist
- Some narrative addition to the outcome
  - Decided by everyone _except_ the player that rolled
  - Often beneficial, but don't have to be

# Cut

- When rolling, the firefly might impose a cut of some number (realistically, 1-3)
  - Difficulty - A task is harder than it might otherwise be
  - Precision - E.g. in combat, aiming for a particular part of a creature
  - Impact - Try to bump the impact up a class
- _After_ rolling, remove the highest value rolls from the pool, before determining the result
- E.g., after rolling `1, 4, 5, 6`, and cutting 2, the highest result is `4`, so the result is a _Conflict_
- Rule of thumb advice is for about a third of rolls to have a cut of some sort (citation needed)

# Impact

- Low, normal, high, and massive
- Determined by how you approach a given action
