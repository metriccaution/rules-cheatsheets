# D&D Rules Cheat-Sheet

A handy little searchable rules cheat-sheet for D&D, built out of little rules snippets in markdown, in [./rules/](./rules/).

Migrated over from an [old mono-repo project](https://metriccaution.github.io/web-snippets/dnd-cheatsheet/).

## Development Instructions

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To build the static site:

```bash
bun run build
```
