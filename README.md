# D&D Rules Cheat-Sheet

A handy little searchable rules cheat-sheet for D&D, built out of little rules snippets in markdown, in [./rules/](./rules/).

Migrated over from an [old mono-repo project](https://metriccaution.github.io/web-snippets/dnd-cheatsheet/).

## Development Instructions

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To start a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

To run for production:

```bash
bun start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.4. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
